Modern organizations receive hundreds (sometimes thousands) of emails daily. Many of these emails are support-related (e.g., customer queries, requests, or help tickets). Manually sifting through these emails, prioritizing them, and drafting professional responses can be time-consuming and error-prone.
Your challenge is to build an AI-Powered Communication Assistant that can intelligently manage these emails end-to-end. The assistant should analyze incoming emails, prioritize them based on urgency, generate appropriate responses, and display the results on a user-friendly dashboard.
The goal is to improve efficiency, response quality, and customer satisfaction while reducing manual effort.

Core Requirements:

Email Retrieval & Filtering
Fetch all incoming emails from the user’s email account (IMAP/Gmail/Outlook APIs, etc.).
Filter emails whose subject lines contain terms like:
“Support”
“Query”
“Request”
“Help”
Extract and display relevant details for each filtered email on the dashboard:
Sender’s email address
Subject
Email body
Date/time received
Categorization & Prioritization
Each eligible email should be automatically categorized and ranked:
Sentiment Analysis: Positive / Negative / Neutral
Priority: Urgent / Not urgent (e.g., based on keywords like “immediately,” “critical,” “cannot access,” etc.)
Emails marked as urgent should appear at the top of the list for processing (implement a priority queue for email processing) 
Context-Aware Auto-Responses
Use an LLM (Large Language Model) to generate draft replies for each incoming email.
Responses must:
Maintain a professional and friendly tone
Be context-aware (e.g., should use a knowledge base to answer these questions (RAG + Prompt Engineering) + respond contexually - if the customer is frustrated, acknowledge their frustration empathetically)
Include relevant details (e.g., if the email mentions a product, reference it in the reply)
Prioritized emails (urgent) should be responded to first.
Information Extraction
From each incoming email, extract key information such as:
Contact details (phone number, alternate email, etc.)
Customer requirements or requests
Sentiment indicators (positive/negative words)
Any metadata that can help support teams act faster
This information should be displayed clearly on the dashboard, alongside the raw email.
Dashboard / User Interface
A simple, clean dashboard where:
The Filtered support emails are listed along with extracted key details in a structured format
Anaytics and Stats are present - Categories (sentiment + priority), total emails recieved in last 24 hours, emails resolved, emails pending, interactive graph to display these details
AI-generated responses are displayed (and can be reviewed/edited before sending)
Technical Guidelines:

You can use any tech stack (Python/Node.js/Java + React/Next.js for frontend, etc.).
For (sentiment, summarization, response generation), you may use: OpenAI GPT models, Hugging Face models (BERT, T5, DistilBERT, etc.)
For email retrieval, use: Gmail, Custom SMTP, Outlook Graph API, or standard IMAP libraries.
For storage, a simple database (SQLite, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL) is sufficient.
